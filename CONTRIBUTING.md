     it, // Italian
   }

   // Add to all switch statements in extension
   case SupportedLanguage.it:
     return 'it'; // or 'Italiano' for display name
   ```

3. **Add translations**
   ```dart
   // In lib/src/data/translation_data.dart
   'it': {
     'unknown_error': 'Si Ã¨ verificato un errore sconosciuto',
     'services': {
       // ... add all service translations
     },
   },
   ```

4. **Add tests**
   ```dart
   test('should translate to Italian', () {
     SupabaseErrorTranslator.setLanguage(SupportedLanguage.it);
     final result = SupabaseErrorTranslator.translateErrorCode(
       'email_not_confirmed',
       ErrorService.auth,
     );
     expect(result.message, 'Email non confermata');
   });
   ```
